# Predicting Diabetes with Support Vector Machines (SVM)

In this notebook, we will explore how Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful machine learning algorithm, can be used for predicting diabetes. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a person is likely to develop diabetes based on a variety of health-related features.

## Problem Overview

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are critical for effective management and prevention of complications. By utilizing machine learning models, we can predict the likelihood of diabetes and help in early intervention.

The dataset used in this project contains information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, age, and other relevant health metrics. The goal is to train an SVM model to classify individuals into two categories: **diabetic** or **non-diabetic**.

## Steps Involved:
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Understanding the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling the features for optimal performance.
2. **Model Training**: Implementing an SVM model with an appropriate kernel to learn patterns in the data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy.
4. **Prediction & Conclusion**: Making predictions and summarizing the results to conclude the effectiveness of the SVM model.

This analysis will provide insights into how machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines, can be applied to real-world healthcare problems like diabetes prediction.

**Libraries used**:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating the SVM model.
